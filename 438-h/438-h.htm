v</span>DEDICATION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are men and classes of men
that stand above the common herd: the soldier, the sailor and the
shepherd not unfrequently; the artist rarely; rarely still, the
clergyman; the physician almost as a rule.&nbsp; He is the flower
(such as it is) of our civilisation; and when that stage of man
is done with, and only remembered to be marvelled at in history,
he will be thought to have shared as little as any in the defects
of the period, and most notably exhibited the virtues of the
race.&nbsp; Generosity he has, such as is possible to those who
practise an art, never to those who drive a trade; discretion,
tested by a hundred secrets; tact, tried in a thousand
embarrassments; and what are more important, Heraclean
cheerfulness and courage.&nbsp; So it is that he brings air and
cheer into the sickroom, and often enough, though not so often as
he wishes, brings healing.</p>
<p><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>Gratitude is but a lame sentiment; thanks, when they are
expressed, are often more embarrassing than welcome; and yet I
must set forth mine to a few out of many doctors who have brought
me comfort and help: to Dr. Willey of San Francisco, whose
kindness to a stranger it must be as grateful to him, as it is
touching to me, to remember; to Dr. Karl Ruedi of Davos, the good
genius of the English in his frosty mountains; to Dr. Herbert of
Paris, whom I knew only for a week, and to Dr. Caissot of
Montpellier, whom I knew only for ten days, and who have yet
written their names deeply in my memory; to Dr. Brandt of Royat;
to Dr. Wakefield of Nice; to Dr. Chepmell, whose visits make it a
pleasure to be ill; to Dr. Horace Dobell, so wise in counsel; to
Sir Andrew Clark, so unwearied in kindness and to that wise
youth, my uncle, Dr. Balfour.</p>
<p>I forget as many as I remember; and I ask both to pardon me,
these for silence, those for inadequate speech.&nbsp; But one
name I have kept on purpose to the last, because it is a
household word with me, and because if I had not received favours
from so many hands and in so many <a name="pagevii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>quarters of the world, it should
have stood upon this page alone: that of my friend Thomas Bodley
Scott of Bournemouth.&nbsp; Will he accept this, although shared
among so many, for a dedication to himself? and when next my
ill-fortune (which has thus its pleasant side) brings him
hurrying to me when he would fain sit down to meat or lie down to
rest, will he care to remember that he takes this trouble for one
who is not fool enough to be ungrateful?</p>

<h2><a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>NOTE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> human conscience has fled of
late the troublesome domain of conduct for what I should have
supposed to be the less congenial field of art: there she may now
be said to rage, and with special severity in all that touches
dialect; so that in every novel the letters of the alphabet are
tortured, and the reader wearied, to commemorate shades of
mis-pronunciation.&nbsp; Now spelling is an art of great
difficulty in my eyes, and I am inclined to lean upon the
printer, even in common practice, rather than to venture abroad
upon new quests.&nbsp; And the Scots tongue has an orthography of
its own, lacking neither &ldquo;authority nor
author.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet the temptation is great to lend a little
guidance to the bewildered Englishman.&nbsp; Some simple phonetic
artifice might defend your verses from barbarous mishandling, and
yet not injure any vested interest.&nbsp; So it seems at first;
but there are <a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
x</span>rocks ahead.&nbsp; Thus, if I wish the diphthong
<i>ou</i> to have its proper value, I may write <i>oor</i>
instead of <i>our</i>; many have done so and lived, and the
pillars of the universe remained unshaken.&nbsp; But if I did so,
and came presently to <i>doun</i>, which is the classical Scots
spelling of the English <i>down</i>, I should begin to feel
uneasy; and if I went on a little farther, and came to a
classical Scots word, like <i>stour</i> or <i>dour</i> or
<i>clour</i>, I should know precisely where I was&mdash;that is
to say, that I was out of sight of land on those high seas of
spelling reform in which so many strong swimmers have toiled
vainly.&nbsp; To some the situation is exhilarating; as for me, I
give one bubbling cry and sink.&nbsp; The compromise at which I
have arrived is indefensible, and I have no thought of trying to
defend it.&nbsp; As I have stuck for the most part to the proper
spelling, I append a table of some common vowel sounds which no
one need consult; and just to prove that I belong to my age and
have in me the stuff of a reformer, I have used modification
marks throughout.&nbsp; Thus I can tell myself, not without
pride, that I have added a fresh stumbling-block for English
readers, and <a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xi</span>to a page of print in my native tongue, have lent a new
uncouthness.&nbsp; <i>Sed non nobis</i>.</p>
<p>I note again, that among our new dialecticians, the local
habitat of every dialect is given to the square mile.&nbsp; I
could not emulate this nicety if I desired; for I simply wrote my
Scots as well as I was able, not caring if it hailed from
Lauderdale or Angus, from the Mearns or Galloway; if I had ever
heard a good word, I used it without shame; and when Scots was
lacking, or the rhyme jibbed, I was glad (like my betters) to
fall back on English.&nbsp; For all that, I own to a friendly
feeling for the tongue of Fergusson and of Sir Walter, both
Edinburgh men; and I confess that Burns has always sounded in my
ear like something partly foreign.&nbsp; And indeed I am from the
Lothians myself; it is there I heard the language spoken about my
childhood; and it is in the drawling Lothian voice that I repeat
it to myself.&nbsp; Let the precisians call my speech that of the
Lothians.&nbsp; And if it be not pure, alas! what matters
it?&nbsp; The day draws near when this illustrious and malleable
tongue shall be quite forgotten; and Burn&rsquo;s Ayrshire, and
Dr. Macdonald&rsquo;s Aberdeen-awa&rsquo;, <a
name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>and
Scott&rsquo;s brave, metropolitan utterance will be all equally
the ghosts of speech.&nbsp; Till then I would love to have my
hour as a native Maker, and be read by my own countryfolk in our
own dying language: an ambition surely rather of the heart than
of the head, so restricted as it is in prospect of endurance, so
parochial in bounds of space.</p>

Yet as he goes he ponders at the helm<br />
Of that bright island; where he feared to touch,<br />
His spirit readventures; and for years,<br />
Where by his wife he slumbers safe at home,<br />
Thoughts of that land revisit him; he sees<br />

Yearning for that far home that might have been.</p>

Thou, with a jar of money, didst embark,<br />

Where most the gods frequent.&nbsp; There Chiron old,<br />
In the Pelethronian antre, taught thee lore:<br />
The plants, he taught, and by the shining stars<br />
In forests dim to steer.&nbsp; There hast thou seen<br />
Immortal Pan dance secret in a glade,<br />
And, dancing, roll his eyes; these, where they fell,<br />
Shed glee, and through the congregated oaks<br />
A flying horror winged; while all the earth<br />
To the god&rsquo;s pregnant footing thrilled within.<br />
Or whiles, beside the sobbing stream, he breathed,<br />
In his clutched pipe unformed and wizard strains<br />

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> year runs
through her phases; rain and sun,<br />
Springtime and summer pass; winter succeeds;<br />
But one pale season rules the house of death.<br />
Cold falls the imprisoned daylight; fell disease<br />
By each lean pallet squats, and pain and sleep<br />
Toss gaping on the pillows.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But O thou!<br />
Uprise and take thy pipe.&nbsp; Bid music flow,<br />
Strains by good thoughts attended, like the spring<br />

Dozing despair awakes.&nbsp; The shepherd sees<br />

Once more the cordage rattle.&nbsp; Airs of home!<br />

Dislimns and disappears, and, opening out,<br />
Shows brooks and forests, and the blue beyond<br />
Of mountains.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Small the pipe; but oh! do thou,<br />
Peak-faced and suffering piper, blow therein<br />
The dirge of heroes dead; and to these sick,<br />
These dying, sound the triumph over death.<br />
Behold! each greatly breathes; each tastes a joy<br />
Unknown before, in dying; for each knows<br />
A hero dies with him&mdash;though unfulfilled,<br />
Yet conquering truly&mdash;and not dies in vain</p>
<p class="poetry">So is pain cheered, death comforted; the
house<br />
Of sorrow smiles to listen.&nbsp; Once again&mdash;<br />

words, and for the sake<br />
Of those, my kinsmen and my countrymen,<br />
Who early and late in the windy ocean toiled<br />
To plant a star for seamen, where was then<br />
The surfy haunt of seals and cormorants:<br />
I, on the lintel of this cot, inscribe<br />
The name of a strong tower.</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Here</span> all is sunny,
and when the truant gull<br />
Skims the green level of the lawn, his wing<br />
Dispetals roses; here the house is framed<br />
Of kneaded brick and the plumed mountain pine,<br />
Such clay as artists fashion and such wood<br />
As the tree-climbing urchin breaks.&nbsp; But there<br />
Eternal granite hewn from the living isle<br />
And dowelled with brute iron, rears a tower<br />
That from its wet foundation to its crown<br />
Of glittering glass, stands, in the sweep of winds,<br />
Immovable, immortal, eminent.</p>

<p class="poetry"><i>My house</i>, I say.&nbsp; But hark to the
sunny doves<br />
That make my roof the arena of their loves,<br />
That gyre about the gable all day long<br />
And fill the chimneys with their murmurous song:<br />
<i>Our house</i>, they say; and <i>mine</i>, the cat declares<br
/>
And spreads his golden fleece upon the chairs;<br />
And <i>mine</i> the dog, and rises stiff with wrath<br />
If any alien foot profane the path.<br />
So too the buck that trimmed my terraces,<br />
Our whilome gardener, called the garden his;<br />
Who now, deposed, surveys my plain abode<br />
And his late kingdom, only from the road.</p>

All the day long to and fro,<br />
And when the night begins to fall<br />
Throw down my bed and sleep, while all<br />
The building hums with wakefulness&mdash;<br />
Even as a child of savages<br />
When evening takes her on her way,<br />
(She having roamed a summer&rsquo;s day<br />
Along the mountain-sides and scalp)<br />
Sleeps in an antre of that alp:&mdash;<br />

My fancy soars like to a kite<br />
<a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>And faints

Not break it, and so weak withal,<br />
Death ebbs and flows in its loose wall<br />
As the green sea in fishers&rsquo; nets,<br />
And tops its topmost parapets:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is so wholly mine that I<br />
Can wield its whole artillery,<br />
And mine so little, that my soul<br />
Dwells in perpetual control,<br />
And I but think and speak and do<br />
As my dead fathers move me to:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If this born body of my bones<br />
The beggared soul so barely owns,<br />
What money passed from hand to hand,<br />
What creeping custom of the land,<br />
What deed of author or assign,<br />

97</span><i>Note</i>.&mdash;It may be guessed by some that I had
a certain parish in my eye, and this makes it proper I should add
a word of disclamation.&nbsp; In my time there have been two
ministers in that parish.&nbsp; Of the first I have a special
reason to speak well, even had there been any to think ill.&nbsp;
The second I have often met in private and long (in the due
phrase) &ldquo;sat under&rdquo; in his church, and neither here
nor there have I heard an unkind or ugly word upon his
lips.&nbsp; The preacher of the text had thus no original in that
particular parish; but when I was a boy, he might have been
observed in many others; he was then (like the schoolmaster)
abroad; and by recent advices, it would seem he has not yet
entirely disappeared.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
