description: "Underwoods is a collection of poems by Robert Louis Stevenson published\
  \ in 1887. It comprises two books, Book I with 38 poems in English, Book II with\
  \ 16 poems in Scots. He says in the initial note that \"I am from the Lothians myself;\
  \ it is there I heard the language spoken about my childhood; and it is in the drawling\
  \ Lothian voice that I repeat it to myself.\"\nThe dedication is to \"a few out\
  \ of many doctors who have brought me comfort and help.\" He starts by saying that\
  \ \"There are men and classes of men that stand above the common herd: the soldier,\
  \ the sailor and the shepherd not infrequently; the artist rarely; rarer still the\
  \ clergyman; the physician almost as a rule. He is the flower (such as it is) of\
  \ our civilization ....\"\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
